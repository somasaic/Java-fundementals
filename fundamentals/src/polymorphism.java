/*
 * Polymorphism is a core concept in object-oriented programming(OOP) 
   that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects 
   of a common superclass. It enables a single interface to be used to 
   represent multiple types of objects and allows methods to behave 
   differently based on the actual object type at runtime.

   There are two types of polymorphism in Java:
    - Compile-time Polymorphism (Method Overloading): 
      This occurs when multiple methods have the same name but different 
      parameters within a class. The appropriate method to be invoked is 
      determined at compile time based on the number and types of arguments 
      passed to the method.

    - Run-time Polymorphism (Method Overriding): 
      This occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a 
      method that is already defined in its superclass. The method in the 
      subclass overrides the method in the superclass, and the specific 
      implementation is determined at runtime based on the actual object type.

Here's a Java code example demonstrating both compile-time and run-time polymorphism:

public class polymorphism {
    
}
